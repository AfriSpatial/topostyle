Vector styling for NGI datasets

--The initial styling of the data was achieved using QGIS and other open source tools namely inkscape vector graphics and gimp.


--In styling the data in QGIS we realised that not all the svg symbols which were specified on the 1:50 000 reference sheets existed in the 
svg directory for QGIS hence the need to recreate the svg symbols using ink scape vector graphics and they are subsequently stored in a folder which can be referenced.

--Since the original styling was done using QGIS it now incorporates the advanced labelling feature which makes it easy for a layer to be labelled and also eliminates the process of bringing in the layer twice in a view in order to label the feautures.

- All the layers which needed labels were labelled using the advanced feature label tool provided in QGIS but the problem encountered is that when the style is saved as an sld the labelling is not incoperated hence the need to edit the sld according to the specifications in order to allow for labels to appear.

--Since the manual editing of sld to incorporate labels the following layers provided dificulties and still could not find a way to get around it. The labels either containes regualar expressions and specifying it in sld provided dificulties.

Examples of labels based upon the advanced labelling feauture in QGIS.

Labelling controlpointpoint

case when  "feat_type" = 'BOUNDARY BEACON' then null
else toint( "height" )
end

The label uses case statement to specify which fields need to be labelled and which attribute is to be used for the label hence eliminating the need to bring the layer twice.
 
Example for labelling structure point

case
      when  "feat_type"  =   'MICROWAVE TOWER' then null
      when  "feat_type"  =  'TELECOM TOWER' then null
      when  "feat_type"  =  'TUNNEL ENTRANCE' then null
else  "feat_type" 
end


List of layers that used special advanced labelling features.

-- airtransport
-- topopointpoint
-- boundaryareaarea.
-- landusearea

since the column that was being used to label the features contained a mixture of string data and integer data and we only wanted to label feautures based on string hence we used the following labelling condition on the advanced labelling feature.

 CASE WHEN "tag" ~ '^[0-9]+$'  THEN NULL 
ELSE "tag"  END

For Landuse area Recreational area needed to be labelled using the following.

substr( "feat_type",0,4)

Issues with sld generated by QGIS.

--Labels did not appear in the sld generated by qgis, so manual editing is needed for the sld according to specifications in order to incoperate labels. But once the sld are edited the work fine in QGIS.

--QGIS does not incoperating regular experessions used in labelling when making its sld document.

-- QGIS sld tended to make most of the lines appear dashed in the sld so there was a need to check the structure of the sld once it was saved in order to see if it saved correctly and tweaking it where necessary.
